                <p>Ribs and frames are an essential component in a thin-walled structure for the reasons discussed next. They are structural elements stiffening the thin-walled beam along its transverse direction. The nomenclature here adopted refers to:</p>

                        <li><strong>Ribs:</strong> Transverse elements in wings/aerodynamic surfaces</li>
                        <li><strong>Frames:</strong> Transverse elements in fuselages or cylindrical shells of space launcher structures (sometimes denoted also as rings)</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <p>The roles played by ribs and frames in thin-walled aerostructures can be summarized as:</p>
                <ol class="numbered-list">
                    <li>They preserve the shape of the section</li>
                    <li>They allow the introduction of loads</li>
                    <li>They stabilize panels and stringers with respect to their buckling response</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <!-- Section 2: Role 1 - Shape Preservation -->
            <section class="section" id="shape-preservation">
                <h2>2. Role 1: Preserving the Shape of the Section</h2>

                <p>The presence of transverse stiffening elements — infinitely stiff along the in-plane directions — ensures that the section shape is not altered due to the applied loads, thus preserving the aerodynamic performance.</p>

                <figure>

                <p>The situation depicted in the figure on the right is prevented thanks to the presence of ribs.</p>

                <div class="key-point">
                    <strong>Key Observation:</strong> This kind of behaviour is consistent with the results derived in the context of DSV (De Saint Venant) theory for torsion, where the section was found to be subjected to a rigid rotation preserving the shape of the section.
                </div>

                <p>The presence of ribs guarantees that the section shape is preserved even when the DSV hypotheses are not fully respected, such as in the case of distributed loads.</p>

                        <p>There is no guarantee that the shape will be preserved; indeed the distributed loads will alter the section as the cover panels are subjected to bending loads.</p>

            <!-- Section 3: Role 2 - Load Introduction -->
            <section class="section" id="load-introduction">
                <h2>3. Role 2: Allowing the Introduction of Loads</h2>

                <p>As a consequence of the previous considerations, it is clear that ribs/frames are of paramount importance for allowing the introduction of loads into the structure. The loads will be, in general, in the form of:</p>
                <ol class="numbered-list" type="a">
                    <li>Distributed loads</li>
                    <li>Concentrated loads</li>
                </ol>

                <p>For thin-walled sections, the load introduction has to be associated with a locally in-plane stiffer region.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/LN_C3_3_Ribs_and_frames/wing_panel_load_introduction_ribs.png" alt="Wing panel showing load introduction at engine location">
                    <figcaption>Figure 3.1: Wing panel diagrams showing load introduction at engine location and resulting rib placement.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>3.1 Rib Placement Considerations</h3>

                <p>During the design phase, a number of ribs will be placed in correspondence of those portions where concentrated loads need to be introduced. In general, the choice for the location of ribs is dictated by the design itself. In particular, ribs will be introduced, at least, in correspondence of:</p>
                <ol class="numbered-list" type="a">
                    <li>Engines</li>
                    <li>Junction between wing and fuselage</li>
                    <li>Openings</li>
                    <li>Actuators</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3.2 Distributed Load Introduction</h3>

                <p>In order to guarantee proper load introduction of the distributed loads, a number of ribs will be introduced to achieve a distribution which is approximately homogeneous.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/LN_C3_3_Ribs_and_frames/tapered_wing_rib_distribution.png" alt="Tapered wing section showing progressive rib distribution">
                    <figcaption>Figure 3.2: Tapered wing section showing progression from sparse to dense rib spacing for homogeneous load distribution.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The regularity of the distribution guarantees that the loads are progressively introduced, in a smooth way, avoiding sudden changes of loads. Furthermore, the ribs provide support for the cover panels, which has a beneficial effect on the bending-induced displacement.</p>

                <h3>3.3 Aspect Ratio and Panel Behavior</h3>

                <p>In this sense it is worth highlighting the relatively high ratio between the chord dimension and the pitch of the ribs:</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/LN_C3_3_Ribs_and_frames/wing_rib_spacing_parameters.png" alt="Wing section with rib spacing parameters">
                    <figcaption>Figure 3.3: Wing section showing chord length c, pitch p, and rib spacing ratio definition.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <div class="definition-box">
                    <h4>Aspect Ratio Definition</h4>
                    <p>Define \(r = c/p\) (aspect ratio)</p>
                    <p>where \(c\) = chord length and \(p\) = pitch (rib spacing)</p>
                </div>

                <p>As a simplified model, it can be assumed that the portion of the panel from rib to rib is a plate supported along the four edges. The effect of the distributed load can be analyzed as an idealization of the cover panel as a simply supported plate.</p>

                <p>An exact solution for this problem can be easily found (the procedure is not illustrated here), and it can be shown that the maximum bending displacement due to the pressure load depends on the aspect ratio. The increase of \(r\) has a drastic effect on the reduction of the bending displacements.</p>

                <h3>3.4 Load Transfer Mechanism</h3>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/LN_C3_3_Ribs_and_frames/rib_spar_web_load_transfer.png" alt="Ribs and spar webs with distributed loads">
                    <figcaption>Figure 3.4: Three-dimensional structural diagrams showing load transfer from panels to ribs and spar webs.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The distributed loads are then transferred from the panels to the ribs and the spar webs, which furnish support to the panels.</p>

                <p>In general, most of the introduction of load happens in correspondence of the ribs, although even the spars do provide a contribution to react the external loads transferred by the panels.</p>

                <div class="key-point">
                    <strong>Design Assumption:</strong> For this reason it can be assumed, at least as an initial scheme for analyzing the structure, that all of the distributed loads are introduced by the ribs. This assumption turns out to be especially true for typical configurations with high values of \(r = c/p\). For \(r = 1\), the load introduced by the rib would be equal to the load introduced by the spars.

                </figure>

                <p>This assumption leads to the following scheme where the load is entirely transferred from the panels to the ribs (thus ignoring the amount of load introduced in the spars).</p>

                <p>It is also noted that the bending of the panels can be seen as a local effect, which is not captured in the context of a DSV beam model.</p>

                <div class="boxed-content">
                    <p>The evolution of the state of stress in a generic section will then be obtained by evaluating \(\sigma_{zz}\) according to the DSV solution and the shear stresses according to the semi-monocoque scheme.</p>
                    <p>These results do not include the local correction which is associated with the local bending of panels (whose evaluation can be performed with a detailed FEM model).</p>

                <p>In the context of the semi-monocoque beam model, it is then assumed that all the loads are introduced in correspondence of the ribs. Some of them (the concentrated ones) are effectively applied to ribs. The distributed ones will be condensed to a set of statically equivalent loads which are applied to ribs.</p>

                <p>As discussed, this operation has the effect of filtering out local effects (mainly due to the bending of panels), while preserving the overall behaviour of the structure.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>Accordingly, the internal forces will be characterized by the following behaviour:</p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Shear \(T_x\), \(T_y\): piecewise constant</li>

                    <li>Torsion \(M_z\): piecewise constant</li>
                </ul>

                <p>It is worth highlighting that the assumption of loads introduced by the ribs is consistent with the beam model and the semi-monocoque scheme adopted.</p>

                <p>The generic panel is subjected to a constant shear flow \(q\), which is constant even along the beam axis.

                <h3>4.1 Euler's Buckling Load</h3>

                <p>As a first approximation, it can be assumed that the stringer would buckle according to Euler's buckling load:</p>

                    \[P_{buck}^{stringer} = \frac{\pi^2 EI}{\lambda^2}\]

                <p>where \(\lambda\) is the halfwave length of the buckled configuration (depends on the constraints).</p>

                <p>Assuming the stringer as pinned to the ribs: \(\lambda^2 = d^2\) (in any case \(\lambda\) is linear with \(d\)).</p>

                <div class="key-point">
                    <strong>Important Result:</strong> It follows that the reduction of the rib pitch has the effect of raising the buckling load:
                    \[\frac{\pi^2 EI}{d_1^2} < \frac{\pi^2 EI}{d_2^2} \quad \text{if} \quad d_2 < d_1\]

                <h2>5. Remarks on the Assumptions Introduced</h2>

                <p>The beam model introduced so far is based on DSV results and has been specialized to the case of thin-walled beams for making possible the evaluation of the shear stresses.</p>

                <p>Within the context of DSV solution, it was found that \(\sigma_{xx} = \sigma_{yy} = \sigma_{xy} = 0\) is part of the exact solution.</p>

                <p>Ribs have now been introduced as in-plane infinitely stiff elements, which means that the section cannot change shape in correspondence of the ribs.</p>

                <div class="boxed-content">
                    <p>The impossibility of changing shape determines then the onset of not null \(\sigma_{xx}\), \(\sigma_{yy}\), and \(\sigma_{xy}\), which is an <strong>inconsistency of the model</strong>.</p>
                </div>

                <figure>

                </figure>

                <p>If no ribs were present, the section highlighted would deform. However, if the presence of the rib is accounted for, the shape is preserved, meaning that an in-plane state of stress is induced for restoring the original shape.</p>

                <div class="two-column">
                    <div class="column">
                        <h5>No Rib</h5>
                        <p>\(\sigma_{xx} = \sigma_{yy} = \sigma_{xy} = 0\)</p>
                    </div>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>These effects fall outside the DSV beam model. They can be seen as local effects, which damp out moving away from the rib. DSV hypotheses are restored at sufficient distance from the rib.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>Clearly, if the rib density is relatively high (as it often is the case), the DSV assumptions may become questionable: the local effects do not have distance enough to damp out as those of the successive rib are immediately present.</p>

                <p>The high density of ribs does not allow \(\sigma_{xx}\), \(\sigma_{yy}\), and \(\sigma_{xy}\) to reach zero value.</p>

                <div class="key-point">
                    <strong>Structural Implication:</strong> From a structural behaviour standpoint, this means that the "real" structure, in comparison to the "ideal" DSV one, will be much stiffer; this is due to the local stiffening of ribs which is not accounted for in the DSV model.

                    <p>To this aim, dependently on the kind of rib under investigation, it is possible to adopt an approximate scheme for evaluating the shear stresses based on the semi-monocoque scheme.</p>

                <p>It is worth highlighting that the analysis of the rib is conducted by evaluating the section where the rib is attached. This is because the two parts are connected with junctions and so there is an exchange of shear flows along the junction lines.</p>

                <p>The analysis procedure is then analogous to the procedure outlined for ribs, as the load introduction and load transfer mechanisms happen in a similar manner.</p>

                <h3>8.1 Advantage of Load Decomposition</h3>

                <p>The advantage of this separation consists in the possibility of solving two problems which are simpler in comparison to the original one:</p>

                <div class="boxed-content">
                    <p><strong>Initial problem:</strong> 3 times statically indeterminate</p>
                    <p>Decomposes into:</p>
                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                        <li><strong>Symmetric load:</strong> 2 times statically indeterminate</li>
                        <li><strong>Anti-symmetric load:</strong> 1 time statically indeterminate</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Indeed, frames are generally symmetric structures that:</p>
                <ol class="numbered-list" type="a">
                    <li>Loaded symmetrically respond symmetrically</li>
                    <li>Loaded anti-symmetrically respond anti-symmetrically</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>8.2 Plane Symmetries</h3>

                </figure>

                <p>As in the case of frames, the possibility of exploiting symmetries in structures is generally a good means for simplifying calculations.</p>

                <p>A common case is given by <strong>plane symmetries</strong>, which are characterized by one (or more) axis which can be considered for rotating the structure of \(\pi\) rad without modifying the structure itself.</p>

                <p>After the rotation takes place, the structure is still equal to its original configuration.</p>

                <p>Whenever one or more of these conditions does not respect symmetry requirements, the analysis cannot be simplified by exploiting any kind of symmetry consideration.</p>

                <h3>8.4 Symmetric and Anti-symmetric Response</h3>

                <p>The discussion has been restricted to the 2D case so far. It is now possible to extend the same ideas to the case of beams in a three-dimensional space.</p>

                <figure>

                <p>In this case, the displacement of a generic point is fully characterized by three displacement components and three rotations. Similarly, the exchange of internal forces is described in terms of three forces and three moments:</p>
