    "description": "Three views showing triangular distributed load patterns on structural members. Top view shows a triangular load distribution decreasing from left to right along a tapered beam element, with upward-pointing force vectors indicating the distributed load intensity. Middle view displays a gray rectangular cross-section with a diagonal line, likely representing a section cut or internal geometry. Bottom view shows the same triangular load distribution pattern on a rectangular beam element, with uniform upward force vectors that decrease in magnitude from left to right following the triangular distribution envelope shown above."
