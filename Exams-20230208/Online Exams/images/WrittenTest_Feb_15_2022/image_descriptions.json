    "description": "Cantilever beam with fixed support (hatched) at left end and free right end. Beam has uniform properties EJ and length ℓ, with coordinate z measured from fixed end. Moment load θ̂ applied at free end. Problem asks to determine bending moment at x = ℓ/2 using both displacement-based and force-based approaches, assuming negligible shear deformation. Given data: ℓ = 1000 mm, θ̂ = 10 deg, EJ = 10¹² N·mm²."

Beam divided into segments with properties EJ, ℓ at positions x₁ and x₂, with vertical displacements z₁,w₁ and z₂,w₂. Applied moment θ̂ at right free end. Eight boundary conditions listed: w₁(0)=0, w₁'(0)=0, w₁(ℓ)=0 for left segment; w₂(0)=0, w₂'''(ℓ)=0, w₂'(ℓ)=-θ̂ for right segment; plus continuity conditions w₁''(ℓ)=w₂''(0) and w₁'(ℓ)=w₂'(0). Solution expressed as cubic polynomials with coefficients A₀ through A₃ and B₀ through B₃, with derivatives shown."

Horizontal member extends 2ℓ with distributed load q applied downward over length ℓ (shown as shaded rectangle). Vertical member extends 2ℓ downward with point load P at bottom. Diagonal member of length ℓ connects at angle, with unknown displacement S marked with question mark. Coordinate system shows vertical (V) and horizontal (P) directions. Problem uses force-based approach to determine displacement S, with shear deformability considered negligible. Given data: ℓ = 1200 mm, q = 2 N/mm, EJ = 10¹² N·mm², P = 2000 N."

Left diagram shows original structure with distributed load q, point loads 2P, and unknown displacement S. Right side shows two separate cases: \"Real\" case with horizontal force P, and \"Dummy\" case with unit force 1. Below are two beam diagrams showing internal force conventions: moment M = -Px and shear SM = -x. Text notes that only real forces producing non-null energy contribution are reported."

Vertical members at positions z₁ and z₃ have pinned supports at base with displacements w₁ and w₃. Point A marked at center of top beam. Problem asks to determine downward deflection of point A at middle of horizontal beam using Ritz method, where deflection for beams #1 and #3 is taken as w₁ = C φ(z₁) and w₃ = C φ(z₃). Note indicates C is same due to problem symmetry. Formulate using single degree of freedom C and choose between φ(z) = z/ℓ or φ(z) = sin(πz/ℓ) or φ(z) = (z/ℓ)². Neglect axial energy contributions."
