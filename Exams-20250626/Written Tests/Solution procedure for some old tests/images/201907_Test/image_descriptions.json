    "description": "Two-view diagram of a thin-walled semi-monocoque beam for Exercise 1. Left view shows 3D perspective of cantilever beam with fixed support at left end (indicated by hatched wall symbol) and free right end, with total length l = 6000 mm. The beam features lumped stringers running longitudinally. Upper right shows distributed load diagram q = q(x) = 150(x/400)² N/mm applied along the beam span, with x ∈ [0, 400] mm, depicted as triangular distribution increasing from left to right. Lower right shows rectangular cross-section with dimensions: width a = 200 mm, height composed of segments b = 200 mm, c = 400 mm, d = 50 mm, and total height e. Panel thickness t = 1.5 mm, stringer area A = 1000 mm². Cross-section shows four corner stringers in a rectangular configuration. Coordinate system indicated with x-axis along beam length, y-axis vertical, and z-axis shown with directional arrows. Problem asks to determine shear and axial stresses at mid-span section using semi-monocoque approximation."

    "description": "Structural diagram for Exercise 2 showing two connected beams with elastic spring supports. Upper beam (labeled with properties EA₁, EJ₁, GJ₁, l₁) is inclined and subjected to linearly varying distributed load q = q(x). Lower beam (labeled EA₂, EJ₂, GJ₂, l₂) is horizontal and subjected to axial point load P at right free end. Left end features fixed support (hatched ground symbol) with two linear springs of stiffness k₁ and k₂ providing elastic constraint. Coordinate system shows x-axis horizontal (positive right). Given data: l₁ = 1000 mm, l₂ = 800 mm; EA₁ = 5.7 × 10⁷ N, EJ₁ = 9.0 × 10⁸ N·mm², GJ₁ = 4.0 × 10⁸ N·mm²; EA₂ = 2.8 × 10⁷ N, EJ₂ = 7.0 × 10⁸ N·mm², GJ₂ = 2.0 × 10⁸ N·mm²; k₁ = 2.8 N/mm, k₂ = 3.5 × 10⁴ N/mm; q = 6 × 10⁻³ × (x/800) N/mm, P = 40 kN. Problem requires determining horizontal and vertical displacement at spring location. Note: EJ₁ = EJ₂₂ = EJ_yy per problem statement."

    "description": "Hand-drawn analysis of diamond-shaped truss structure subjected to distributed loading. Top portion shows two views: left view displays truss with triangular distributed load q = 150(ξ/400)² applied to top horizontal member, with load distribution curve shown above; right view shows same truss geometry with resultant force F₀ (vertical arrow) and moment M₀ (curved arrow) at apex. Truss consists of four pin-jointed members forming diamond configuration with nodes at left, right, top (apex), and bottom vertices. Vertical dashed lines indicate symmetry and reference positions. Below diagrams are calculations showing: F₀ = ∫₀⁴⁰⁰ 150(ξ/400)² dξ = 20 kN (resultant force); M₀ = ∫₀⁴⁰⁰ 150(ξ/400)² ξ dξ = 6·10⁶ N·mm (resultant moment). Bottom portion shows two additional truss diagrams labeled \"Flows\" (left, units N/mm) and \"Stresses\" (right, units MPa) with numerical values at each member: Flows diagram shows values 21.49, 4.83, 0, 0, 26.75, 10.09; Stresses diagram shows values 14.33, 3.22, 0, 0, 17.83, 6.73. Analysis demonstrates conversion of distributed load to equivalent concentrated force and moment for truss analysis."

    "description": "Hand-drawn diagram titled \"Axial stress in the stringers\" showing diamond-shaped truss structure with coordinate system and dimensional annotations. Truss has four nodes labeled 1 (top apex), 2 (left), 3 (right), and 4 (bottom), connected by pin-jointed members. Coordinate system shows x-axis horizontal (positive right), y-axis vertical (positive up), with origin at center of truss. Vertical dimension of 350 mm marked from center to bottom node. At apex, resultant force F₀ (upward arrow) and moment M₀ (curved arrow) are shown, with notation indicating moment M_x acts about member 2. Annotations state: \"the vertical position of the principal axis origin is at 350 mm from the bottom\" and \"the horizontal position is available from the symmetry of the section.\" Below diagram are stress calculations: M_x = -F₀·z (bending moment expression); at mid-span section z = 3000 mm: M_x = -6.00·10⁷ N·mm. Stringer stresses calculated as: σ_xx,1 = (M_x/J_xx)(600-350) = -78.95 MPa; σ_xx,2 = σ_xx,3 = (M_x/J_xx)(400-350) = -15.79 MPa; σ_xx,4 = (M_x/J_xx)(-350) = 110.53 MPa. Analysis determines axial stress distribution in four corner stringers of semi-monocoque beam cross-section."

    "description": "Hand-drawn analysis diagram for Exercise 2 showing reference frame definitions and moment equations for two-beam spring-supported structure. Top sketch shows overall system: upper inclined beam (labeled 1) with distributed load q, lower horizontal beam (labeled 2) with axial force F, connected at left by springs k₁ and k₂ to fixed support (hatched ground). Below are three detailed sketches: left shows beam with distributed load q, global coordinates X-Y, and force F; center shows \"Ref. systems\" with local coordinate systems (x₁, y₁, z₁) for beam 1 and (x₂, y₂, z₂) for beam 2, with spring k₂ at connection; right shows similar view emphasizing coordinate orientations. Distributed load relationship given as q(z₂) = a·z₂ with a = 7.5·10⁻⁶ N/mm². Below are moment equations for each beam: M_x⁽²⁾ = -a(z₂³/6) (beam 2 bending moment); M_x⁽¹⁾ = -(a·ℓ₂²/2 + Y)z₁ (beam 1 bending moment including reaction Y); M_y⁽¹⁾ = -(F + X)z₁ (beam 1 torsional moment including reaction X); M_z⁽¹⁾ = a·ℓ₂³/6 (beam 1 out-of-plane moment). Diagram establishes local reference frames and internal moment expressions for displacement analysis of spring-supported two-beam system."
