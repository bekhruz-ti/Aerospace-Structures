    "description": "Thin-walled beam with semi-circular cross-section supported by two linear elastic springs at both ends. The beam has length l = 2000 mm and is oriented diagonally in 3D space. Left end shows a semi-circular cross-section with radius R = 200 mm, featuring five webs of thickness t = 1 mm and four stringers of equivalent area A = 200 mm². Vertical upward force P = 1 kN applied at left end. Both ends have spring supports with stiffness k = 10⁶ N/mm, indicated by hatched ground symbols. Right end shows fixed support with hatching. Material properties: E = 70 GPa, ν = 0.3. Cross-section detail at left shows the semi-circular profile with radius R marked. Problem involves determining spring reaction forces accounting for beam shear deformability and plotting internal actions."

    "description": "Horizontal bar with linearly varying cross-sectional area A(x), fixed at left end (hatched support) and free at right end. Bar length l = 400 mm with cross-sectional area varying from A₀ = 5 mm² at left to A₁ = 15 mm² at right, expressed as EA = EA(x). Uniformly distributed axial load n̂ = 2 N/mm applied along entire length (shown by rightward arrows above bar). Concentrated axial force P = 1 kN applied at free right end (rightward arrow). Material properties: E = 70 GPa, ν = 0.3. Problem involves Ritz solution with one degree of freedom to determine stress and displacement at midspan, comparing with exact solution."

    "description": "Semi-circular thin-walled frame structure showing shear flow distribution analysis. Frame consists of four nodes (labeled 1, 2, 3, 4) connected by curved and straight segments forming a semi-circular shape with vertical left edge. Nodes are numbered: node 2 at top, node 1 at mid-height left, node 3 at mid-height right, and node 4 at bottom left. Shear flows labeled q₁, q₂, q₃, q₄ along curved segments and q₅ along horizontal center chord connecting nodes 1 and 3. Vertical upward force P = 1000 N applied at bottom with moment arm x_ic. Handwritten notes indicate \"Evolution of section properties (GA*)\" and analysis involves shear flow equations, equivalence to moment, and compatibility conditions (θ₁ = θ₂ and θ₁ = 0). Calculated shear flows: q₁ = q₄ = 1.5275 N/mm, q₂ = q₃ = -0.9725 N/mm. Torsional stiffness x_ic = 122.20 mm noted. Cross-sectional area A* = 654.65 mm² and torsional rigidity GA* = 1.76 × 10⁷ N calculated."

    "description": "Semi-circular thin-walled frame with torsional moment analysis. Frame shows same geometry as previous with nodes 1-4 and shear flows q₁, q₂, q₃, q₄ along curved segments, plus q₅ along horizontal chord and torsional moment M_t = 10⁶ N·mm applied. Handwritten calculations show: bending stiffness EJ = E(2AR²) = 1.12 × 10¹² N·mm², and torsional analysis with uniform shear flows q₁ = q₂ = q₃ = q₄ = 7.96 N/mm and q₅ = 0. Torsional constant calculation shown: J_t = M_t / (1/(2Ω_cell_k) Σ(q_k l_k/t_k)) = 1.54 × 10⁷ mm⁴, where summation is over panel belonging to cell #k (can consider cell #1 or #2). Final result: GJ = G·J_t = 4.13 × 10¹¹ N·mm². Diagram includes triangular symbols at nodes indicating support/connection points."

Left side shows 3D beam with semi-circular cross-section at left end, fixed support (hatched) at top right, with vertical force P and forces X, Y labeled. Beam axis runs diagonally along length with note \"beam axis running along the shear center portions\". Right side shows two local coordinate systems: first system (x₁, y₁, z₁) at location P+X with rotation angle Yd, second system (x₂, y₂, z₂) at distance d = x_ic with similar orientation.
