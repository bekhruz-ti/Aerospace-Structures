    "description": "Side and front views of a thin-walled beam structure for spacecraft applications. Side view shows a beam of total length l with equally spaced ribs at pitch d. The beam is subjected to a distributed pressure load p acting vertically upward (shown by multiple arrows), uniform along the beam axis and varying linearly along the chord according to p = p₀(η/(b+c)), where η is the chordal coordinate and ξ is the axial coordinate. The front view shows the triangular pressure distribution profile across the chord width, with pressure p varying from zero at one edge to maximum at the other edge (dimension η indicated). The beam features multiple internal ribs (shown as vertical lines in side view) that provide structural support. This diagram represents a semi-monocoque beam configuration typical in aerospace structures, where the loading simulates aerodynamic or internal pressure effects on a thin-walled structure."

    "description": "Rectangular cross-section of a thin-walled semi-monocoque beam showing the internal stringer configuration. The cross-section has overall height a = 200 mm and is divided into two cells by a central vertical web. The left cell has width b = 200 mm and the right cell has width c = 300 mm. Three vertical stringers are visible: one at each corner and one central stringer dividing the two cells. The detail view on the right shows the stringer profile dimensions, with height h = 20 mm and flange width h (forming an L-shaped or angle section). The outer panels (top, bottom, and sides) have thickness t = 0.8 mm. This cross-section is used for semi-monocoque analysis where stringers carry axial loads and panels resist shear stresses. The problem context indicates analysis is required at section ξ = 900 mm along the beam length to determine shear flows, shear stresses in panels, and axial forces in stringers."

    "suggested_name": "beam_variable_stiffness_springs_distributed_load",
    "description": "Euler-Bernoulli beam with variable bending stiffness supported by elastic springs and subjected to distributed loading. The beam has total length l = 2a + b = 1000 mm, divided into three segments: left segment of length a = 300 mm, center segment of length b = 400 mm, and right segment of length a = 300 mm. The left end (ξ = 0) is fixed (shown by hatched support symbol preventing translation and rotation), and the right end is hinged (shown by hatched support allowing rotation but preventing translation). Two linear springs of stiffness k = 100 N/mm provide transverse elastic support at positions ξ = a and ξ = a + b (at the boundaries between segments). The bending stiffness varies linearly: EJ₀ = 1e9 Nmm² at ξ = 0 increasing to EJ₁ = 2EJ₀ at ξ = 2a + b. A uniform distributed load q = 20 N/mm acts downward (shown by vertical arrows) over the interval a + b ≤ ξ ≤ 2a + b (the right segment of length a). Coordinate ξ is measured along the beam axis from the fixed end. This problem involves applying the Ritz method with single-degree-of-freedom approximation to determine the displacement field of the beam under combined elastic support and distributed loading."
