    "description": "Two-view diagram of a thin-walled cantilever beam for Exercise 1. Left view shows 3D perspective of beam with total length l, fixed support at left end (indicated by hatching), and triangular distributed load q = q(x) applied at the free right end. Right view shows detailed cross-sectional geometry: trapezoidal/pentagonal thin-walled section with four lumped stringers at corners. Cross-section dimensions labeled as: top width a, height on right side b, total height c, and offset dimension d from top. Small inset diagram above cross-section shows distributed load variation q = q(x) decreasing linearly along coordinate x over distance a. Coordinate system with y-axis vertical and d-axis shown. Problem involves semi-monocoque beam analysis with stringer area A and panel thickness t, subjected to distributed force per unit length varying with position x ∈ [0, 400] mm, with specific formula q = 150(x/400)² N/mm."

    "description": "Structural diagram for Exercise 2 showing a two-beam assembly with elastic spring supports. Upper beam (labeled EA₁, EJ₁, GJ₁, l₁) is inclined at approximately 45 degrees, fixed at left end (indicated by hatching), and connected to lower beam at junction point. Lower beam (labeled EA₂, EJ₂, GJ₂, l₂) is horizontal, supported by two linear springs: spring k₂ at left junction point and spring k₁ at far left (both shown with spring symbols and hatching indicating ground). Horizontal axial force P applied at right free end of lower beam pointing right. Distributed load q = q(x) applied along upper beam, shown with downward arrows varying along length. Coordinate axis x shown below lower beam pointing right. Problem involves determining horizontal and vertical displacements at spring locations under combined axial force P = 40 kN and position-dependent distributed load q = 6 × 10⁻³(x/800) N/mm, with given spring stiffnesses k₁ = 2.8 N/mm and k₂ = 3.5 × 10⁴ N/mm."
