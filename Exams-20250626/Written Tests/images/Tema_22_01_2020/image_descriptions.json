    "description": "Isometric view of a semi-monocoque wing-like structure subjected to constant pressure distribution p = 0.002 MPa. The structure consists of an encastred (fixed) wing root at the left end and extends to a free tip over span length l = 6 m. Four equally-spaced ribs introduce the distributed pressure load along the wing span, shown as vertical arrows pointing downward on the upper surface. The wing has chord length c = 1 m and features a rectangular cross-section with corner radius r = 0.1 m. Three panel thicknesses are specified: t₁ = 1 mm, t₂ = 1.2 mm, and t₃ = 1.5 mm, with concentrated areas A = 2500 mm². Multiple cross-sections labeled 'A' are indicated at various spanwise locations. The diagram includes dimension annotations showing the chord c, panel thicknesses t₁ and t₃ at the root, and the overall span l. The structure represents a typical aerospace semi-monocoque construction with skin panels supported by transverse ribs, used for analyzing axial stress σ in concentrated areas and shear stress τ in panels at the section located l/2 from the wing tip."

    "description": "Planar frame structure consisting of three members forming an angular configuration with two fixed supports. The horizontal base member spans length 2l₂ = 1 m with fixed support at left end (shown with hatching symbol indicating prevented translation and rotation). Two inclined members of length l₁ = 2 m extend upward from the base at angles, each terminating in a fixed support (hatched symbols at upper ends). The left inclined member is labeled with properties EA₁, EJ₁, GJ₁, while the right inclined member has identical properties. The horizontal base member has properties EA₂, EJ₂, GJ₂. A uniformly distributed load p = 3 N/mm acts vertically downward on the horizontal base member, indicated by downward arrows along its length. Material and geometric properties are specified: E = 70000 MPa, A₁ = 1 cm², A₂ = 2 cm², J₁ = 1/12 cm⁴, J₂ = 1.33 cm⁴, GJ₁ = 9×10⁷ Nmm², GJ₂ = 18×10⁷ Nmm². The problem requires computation of constraint reaction forces and moments at the three fixed supports. A coordinate system arrow is shown at the upper right indicating positive directions."
