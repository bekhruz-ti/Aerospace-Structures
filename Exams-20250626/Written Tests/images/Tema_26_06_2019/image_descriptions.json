    "description": "Three-dimensional isometric view of a single-cell, thin-walled rectangular beam with length 2l (l = 1500 mm) showing a rectangular cross-section with dimensions a × b (a = 400 mm, b = 250 mm). The beam is fixed at the right end (indicated by hatching) and has a concentrated force F = 10 kN applied at the lower left corner pointing downward and to the left. Four corner stringers are labeled: A₁ (bottom stringers with area A₁ = 2000 mm²) and A₂ (top stringers with area A₂ = 1000 mm²). The beam has three panels with thicknesses t₁ = 1 mm (bottom panel), t₂ = 2 mm (rear panel), and t₃ = 1.5 mm (side panels). Two distributed loads are shown: q₁ = 90 N/mm applied along the bottom left edge (shown with small arrows pointing inward) and q₂ = 300 N/mm applied along the top left edge (shown with small arrows pointing inward). A coordinate system is implied with the beam oriented diagonally in space. The diagram represents Exercise 1 from an aerospace structures problem involving shear stress and axial stress analysis at a section located at distance l/2 from the constraint."

    "description": "Structural frame composed of three beams forming an asymmetric configuration. The left beam of length l₂ (l₂ = 500 mm) is horizontal and supported by an elastic spring constraint (shown with spring symbol k = 400 N/mm) at its left end. This beam connects to two inclined beams, each of length l₁ (l₁ = 1000 mm), which rise at an angle to meet at a fixed support (indicated by hatching) at the upper right. A concentrated vertical downward load P = 2 kN is applied at the junction where the horizontal beam meets the two inclined beams. To the right of the main diagram is a detail view showing the square cross-section of the beams: four stringers (shown as filled circles) at the corners of a square with side dimension a (a = 100 mm), connected by panels of thickness t = 1 mm. The cross-section has stringer area A = 200 mm² and material properties E = 70 GPa and ν = 0.3. This diagram represents Exercise 2 involving vertical displacement analysis and strain energy calculations with and without shearing stiffness contribution."
