    "description": "Semi-monocoque wing structure showing two views: a three-dimensional perspective view (left) and a plan view with pressure distribution (right). The wing features a rectangular box-beam configuration with four corner stringers labeled A₁ (appearing at three corners, with cross-sectional area 75 mm²) and one stringer labeled A₂ (cross-sectional area 100 mm²). The cross-section shows web thicknesses t₁ = 1 mm and t₂ = 0.5 mm. \n    \n    Key dimensions include: total wing length l = 3000 mm, central span w₁ = 300 mm, end sections w₂ = 40 mm and d = 20 mm, wing depth h = 60 mm, and plan dimension w₃ = 60 mm. The structure shows diagonal bracing members connecting the stringers within the box section.\n    \n    The right view displays a triangular pressure distribution p applied to the wing surface, with pressure arrows showing intensity varying linearly along dimension w₃. The pressure magnitude is p = 2 MPa. Material properties specified are Young's modulus E = 72000 MPa and Poisson's ratio ν = 0.3. The diagram includes hatching at the left end indicating a fixed support condition, and dimension l₁ = 1100 mm marking a specific location along the span where rotation angle analysis is required."

    "description": "Three-dimensional isometric view of a cantilever beam system consisting of a rectangular hollow cross-section beam (h × w × t dimensions) joined to a beam with torsional stiffness GJ. The rectangular section beam is shown with fixed support at the upper left end (indicated by hatching marks) and extends downward at an angle. The beam has height h = 700 mm, width w = 30 mm, and wall thickness t = 5 mm.\n    \n    The rectangular beam connects to a horizontal beam element of length l = 1000 mm that possesses torsional stiffness GJ = 22 Nm². The horizontal beam is loaded by a distributed moment per unit length m = 4 N along its entire length l, represented by small arrows indicating the direction of the applied torque. The connection point between the two beam segments is at the free end of the rectangular section.\n    \n    Material properties specified are Young's modulus E = 72000 MPa and Poisson's ratio ν = 0.3. The diagram shows a three-dimensional coordinate system with the distributed torsional loading m applied along the horizontal beam axis. The problem setup is designed for analyzing vertical displacement and rotation at the beam free extremity under combined bending and torsional loading."
