    "description": "Left diagram shows a beam of length l with roller support at left end and fixed support at right end, subjected to uniformly distributed upward load q along its length. Coordinate system shows y-axis vertical, x and z axes horizontal. Right diagram displays a rectangular cross-section labeled \"SECT A-A\" with dimensions a × a, showing two regions labeled E₁ and E₂ with diagonal hatching patterns indicating different material properties or stress distributions."

    "description": "Cantilever beam with fixed support (hatched) at left end and free right end. Beam length l with vertical spring support of stiffness k shown at the free end (indicated by zigzag spring symbol and ground symbol). Labels show EI_xx, GA indicating bending stiffness and shear rigidity properties. Vertical force F shown with upward arrow at right end."

    "suggested_name": "two_member_frame_roller_pinned_distributed_load",
    "description": "Two-member frame structure with horizontal member A-B and inclined member B-C. Point A has fixed support (hatched), point B has roller support on ground (circles with hatching), and distributed load q₂ acts along inclined member B-C shown by arrows. Coordinate system shows y-axis vertical and x-axis horizontal. Points labeled A, B, and C with angle indicators at joints."

    "suggested_name": "semi_monocoque_beam_stringers_distributed_loads",
    "description": "Three-dimensional isometric view of semi-monocoque beam structure showing four longitudinal stringers (bold lines) at corners of rectangular cross-section with dimension a × a. Multiple cross-sections of length l shown with distributed loads (upward arrows) applied to top surface and side surfaces. Points A and B marked on stringers, with dotted lines indicating internal structure. Coordinate system shows length l along beam axis. Structure appears to represent a box beam with skin panels and corner stringers subjected to aerodynamic or pressure loading."

    "description": "Beam with fixed supports (hatched) at both ends, total length l divided into two equal segments l/2. Applied moment M_x shown at midspan with curved arrow indicating clockwise rotation. Label EI_ax indicates axial bending stiffness. Horizontal dimension arrows show beam subdivided into l/2 and l/2 segments."

    "suggested_name": "two_point_masses_beam_length_l",
    "description": "Simple beam of length l with two point masses (shown as filled circles) labeled as points 1 and 2. Coordinate system shows y-axis vertical, x-axis horizontal, and ξ (xi) axis vertical on right side. Points are positioned symmetrically along the beam length. Diagram appears to represent a discrete mass system or lumped mass model for dynamic analysis."
