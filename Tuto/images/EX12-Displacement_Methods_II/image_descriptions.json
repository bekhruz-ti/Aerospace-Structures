    "description": "Cantilever beam with fixed support at left end (x = 0) and spring support at right end (x = ℓ). The beam is subjected to a linearly varying distributed load that increases from zero at the left end to maximum intensity p at the right end, shown by downward arrows of increasing length. A vertical upward displacement v is indicated at the right end, with a spring of stiffness k connecting the right end to ground. The coordinate system shows x-axis horizontal (positive right), y-axis vertical (positive up), and z-axis out of page. Beam length is ℓ = 2000 mm. Given parameters: p = 44 N/mm (maximum distributed load intensity), EJ = 10¹⁰ N·mm² (flexural rigidity), k = 100 N/mm (spring stiffness). The problem involves finding displacement v using a 1-term polynomial approximation with boundary conditions v(0) = 0 and v'ₓ(0) = 0 (fixed end), and v(ℓ) = 0 (spring support condition)."

    "description": "Beam with fixed support at left end (node 1) and free right end (node 3), discretized into two linear finite elements. The beam is subjected to uniform distributed load p(x) = 10 N/mm acting downward along entire length ℓ = 3000 mm. Three nodes are labeled: node 1 at x = 0 (fixed), node 2 at x = ℓ/2 (midpoint), and node 3 at x = ℓ (free end with displacement U₃ shown in green). Each element has length ℓₑ = ℓ/2. Distributed load shown by uniform downward arrows with label p. Given parameters: EA = 7×10⁵ N (axial rigidity). The diagram shows the global beam configuration and the finite element discretization with element boundaries at ℓ/2 intervals. Below the main diagram is a local element reference showing shape functions N₁(x) and N₂(x) for a two-node element with nodal displacements u₁ and u₂, illustrating linear interpolation between nodes."

    "description": "Simply supported beam with pinned support at left end (x = 0) and roller support at right end (x = ℓ). The beam is subjected to uniform distributed load f acting downward along entire length, shown by uniform downward arrows. A spring of stiffness k is attached at midspan (x = ℓ/2), connecting the beam to ground, with upward displacement v indicated at the spring location. The coordinate system shows x-axis horizontal (positive right) and y-axis vertical (positive up). Beam total length is ℓ = 1000 mm, with midspan at ℓ/2. Given parameters: EJ = 1E+12 N·mm² (flexural rigidity), k = 8 MPa·(N/mm)·(1/mm) = 8 N/mm (spring stiffness), f = 100 N/mm (uniform distributed load intensity). The problem involves finding displacement v using trigonometric approximation with solution form v(x) = A·sin(πx/ℓ) satisfying boundary conditions v(0) = 0 and v(ℓ) = 0 at the supports."

    "description": "Two-node finite element with nodes at x = 0 (node 1) and x = 1 (node 2), subjected to curved distributed load f(x) = -4x³ + 4x. The element is shown with both nodes having vertical displacement degrees of freedom u₁ (upward at left node) and u₂ (upward at right node). The distributed load is represented by curved arrows showing varying intensity along the element length, with the load distribution following the cubic polynomial function. The element has unit length (ℓ = 1 mm as stated in problem context). A local coordinate system is shown with x-axis horizontal (positive right). The problem asks to compute virtual work of the force for virtual displacement of node 2. Given data: f(x) = -4x² + 4x N/mm (distributed force intensity). The diagram illustrates the finite element setup for virtual work calculation with shape functions N₁(x) = (1-x) and N₂(x) = x for linear interpolation of displacement field u(x) = N₁·u₁ + N₂·u₂."

    "description": "Single rectangular bilinear finite element in plane stress with four nodes arranged in a rectangle. Node 1 at top-left, node 2 at top-right, node 3 at bottom-left, and node 4 at bottom-right. The element has width a = 4 mm (horizontal dimension) and height b = 3 mm (vertical dimension). Coordinate system shows x-axis horizontal (positive right), y-axis vertical (positive up). Boundary conditions: nodes 1, 3, and 4 have constrained displacements (u₁ = u₃ = u₄ = 0 and v₁ = v₃ = v₄ = 0), indicated by hatched fixed support symbols at left edge and bottom-right corner. Node 2 (top-right) is loaded by vertical downward force F = 100 N and has horizontal displacement u₂ shown in green (to be determined). Material properties: E = 72000 MPa (Young's modulus), ν = 0.3 (Poisson's ratio), unit thickness t = 1 mm. The element uses bilinear shape functions meaning displacement fields u(x,y) and v(x,y) are linear in both x and y directions. Problem involves computing horizontal displacement u of top-right node under plane stress conditions with constitutive relation σ = [E/(1-ν²)]·[1,ν,0; ν,1,0; 0,0,(1-ν)/2]·ε."
